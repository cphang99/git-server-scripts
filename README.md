# Git-server-scripts

Runs a rudimentary git server (tested on the raspberry pi)

Ideal for those that want a highly lightweight means of managing a git server within a small team.

Available commands:
- Setup a repository
- Remove a repository
- List all repositories

This does not provide any granular user access or push/pull restrictions.
